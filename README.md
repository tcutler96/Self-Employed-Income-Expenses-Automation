# Finance Data Automation System

Developed a suite of three integrated Python scripts to automate personal finance management, covering income, expenses, and invoice processing. The system eliminates manual data entry, improves accuracy, and ensures consistent record-keeping across multiple data sources.

Process Invoices: Connects securely to an Outlook inbox via IMAP, retrieves emails from predefined senders, extracts attached invoices or reports (PDF/CSV), and saves them in structured folders by financial year and date range.

Process Income: Reads income transaction CSV files from multiple financial year directories, consolidates them into an Excel workbook, updates totals automatically, and prevents duplicate entries.

Process Expenses: Records and organises expenses within an Excel workbook, automatically sorting them by date and financial year, calculating totals, and maintaining backup copies of previous files.

Overall Impact: Streamlined repetitive financial tracking tasks, reduced errors, and improved data transparency through automated reporting.

Skills Demonstrated: Python OOP, file and email automation (IMAP), PDF and CSV parsing, Excel file manipulation, data validation, workflow optimisation, and financial data management.
